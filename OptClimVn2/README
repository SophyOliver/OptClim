file -- all python scripts *should* be internally documented. When I know how to use sphinx the quality might be better..
Uses python 2.7 TODO update to python 3.6 which is largely a question of turning print "" into print("")
comp_obs.py -- computes simulated observations as used in Tett et al, 2017
ModelSimulation.py -- a general class to handle model configurations.
The general approach is to copy a reference case then modify it.
HadCM3.py - a class to suport HadCM3 (and related)  models. (Supports coupled and atmosphere only models).
   This needs version 0.21 of f90nml.
Optimise.py -- provides functions for GaussNewton optimisation.
ref_code.py -- original (Kuniko) implementation used to test Optimise. Could probably be deleted if test_Optimise modified.
StudyConfig.py -- provides methods to read and write from configuration files.
Submit.py -- provides functions to submit -- just two currently. A dummy one and one for eddie (cluster at Edinburgh)
test_XXXXX -- unit tests for the modules above. test cases should be run from "main level" as configurations are used.


Porting:
1) Add a function in Submit which does the submission. Easiest approach is to copy and modify eddieSubmit.
2) Add a model class -(new python module) - see HadCM3.py for an example.
   This probably best done with help from Simon as documentation not very clear.
3) Decide what optimisation algorithm you want.
4) Modify runOptimise so that it uses the correct submission method & model class.
  If you are feeling helpful you might put this in the configuration json file and possibly modify StudyConfig to deal with it.
